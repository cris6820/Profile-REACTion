# Profile REACTion

Deployed site: https://cris6820.github.io/Profile-REACTion/ 

This is my react portfolio! for future development there can be many additions. For example adding in completed projects, giving the site more design, and adding in a section where messages can be sent directly to me.


AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
WHEN I load the portfolio
THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
